# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Repository created for the 6529 network's art protocol: 6529 Stream, 6529
  Editions and 6529 Stream Federated.
- ADR 0001 records the accepted v1 scope (originally 6529Stream ADR 0055).
- CI: the budget gate measures an explicit Foundry profile (`--profile`, default
  `default`) and fails cleanly on malformed `forge build --sizes` output.
- CI: a parallel **Static analysis** job runs Slither (hash-locked, pinned) and fails on
  any High or Medium finding without a row in `docs/security/slither-triage.md`.
